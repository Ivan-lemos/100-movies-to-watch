Practical Application: Extracting Movie Data
Empire's "100 Greatest Movies Of All Time" list. This is a huge list of one hundred movies that everyone should have watched at some point in their life.

We can pull out the relevant parts to us, namely the title and the ranking of each movie. We will use this to compile a list of movies that we have to watch. We can look at the list, cross out the ones we have already seen, and then pick one at random from the list so that we can watch all of the hundred movies of all time.

Key Takeaways
BeautifulSoup is a Python module used for parsing HTML and extracting data from websites.
Web scraping is useful when websites do not provide APIs or when APIs have limited functionality.
Websites' HTML code can be complex and tangled, requiring an HTML parser to extract relevant information.
By mastering BeautifulSoup, you can extract specific data such as movie titles and rankings from web pages to create useful lists.
